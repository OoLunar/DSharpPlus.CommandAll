# OoLunar.DSharpPlus.CommandAll
Because not everyone can decide between slash commands and text commands.

# What is it?
CommandAll (CA for short) is a library that allows you to use both slash commands and text commands in your bot. The goal is to support all features of both types of command systems without compromising on either.

# Support
If you need help with CommandAll, you can join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JsSrMRNqus); be sure to grab the Programmer role from #rules. Additionally you can open up a new Github Discussion for support. If you believe you've found a bug, please open up a new issue with a minimum reproduction.
